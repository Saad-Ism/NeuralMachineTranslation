# Neural Machine Translation (NMT) — English to French 🇬🇧➡️🇫🇷

This project implements a sequence-to-sequence RNN-based Neural Machine Translation model using TensorFlow and Keras. It covers:

- LSTM-based Encoder–Decoder architecture
- Tokenization and preprocessing of parallel corpora
- Training with teacher forcing
- Inference with greedy decoding
- BLEU score evaluation
- Checkpointing and model restore

### Example

**Input:** go .  
**Predicted French:** tom est !
